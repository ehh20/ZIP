This repository contains some functions for fitting what might be called 'ZIP-INGARCH(1,q)' (zero-inflated Poisson Integer-valued GARCH) models to a network count process.

Brief description of file contents:

-   `ZIP.R` has functions for estimating parameters for the univariate case and for forecasting and evaluating model fit.

-   `Functions_inputs_descriptions` contains a 'glossary' of the arguments used in the different functions.
