List of some repeatedly used function inputs, 
in the form [name] ([default value if it is optional]): [description]
-	data: a length T (total number of timesteps) vector (for univariate), or n x T matrix
(for multivariate) of observations
-	theta: vector into which all the parameters have been concatenated, in the order d, 
A, B, gamma, alpha, beta, where matrices are flattened by row, and B and beta begin
with the coefficients corresponding to the most recent lagged values. Does not include
coefficients for exogeneous covariates if taken as input for multivariate simulations,
otherwise exogeneous covariates are appended at the end of the vector.  
-	n (=2): an integer number of nodes for the multivariate model 
-	ll (=F): set to T for a log-linear model
-	marginal (=T): set to F for a jointly zero-inflated multivariate model
-	arp (=1): lag order of response variables in \lambda_t
-	parp (=1): lag order of response variables in p_t or p_{i, t}
-	burnin (=100): length of the burn-in period
-	t.max (=500): number of time-steps returned in the simulated process
-	lchange: EM algorithm terminates when the percentage decrease between successive
incomplete log-likelihoods is < lchange
-	max.iters: EM algorithm terminates when the number of iterations exceeds max.iters
-	M_maxits (=500): number of iterations of the Nelder-Mead algorithm in the maximisation step of EM
-	adj_mat (=0 fits a full model): If using the constraint ‘o’, the adjacency matrix
needs to have 1’s on the diagonal otherwise it will not be autoregressive. If using the
constraint ‘g’, do not include 1’s on the diagonal. 
-	past_vals (=0 uses a burn-in): include max(arp, parp) past values to 
-	past_intensity (=0 uses a burn-in):  input the intensity at the previous time step. 
-	exo (=0 no exogeneous covariates): an n x T matrix of exogeneous covariates – 1 value per node per timestep. 
-	exo_coefs (=0 no exogeneous covariates):  a length n vector of coefficients for
exogeneous covariates, to use in mzip simulations. 
-	constraint (=’o’): Set constraint=’g’ to impose further constraints on the
coefficients that determine the effects of neighbouring nodes, as described in
subsection 3.2.1. 
-	global.neighbour (=T) Set to F for coefficients for regressors going into different
nodes to be distinct. 
-	ints: a length T vector (univariate), or n x T matrix (multivariate) of fitted
intensities if drawing from the Poisson distribution at time t. These can be obtained
using zip.fitted or mzip.fitted. 
-	probs: a length T vector (zip or jointly zero-inflated mzip) or n x T matrix of
fitted probabilities of drawing from the ‘zero distribution’ at time t. 
-	fitted: a list containing two elements ‘ints’ and ‘probs’ as defined above (usually
used for evaluating forecasted densities). 
-	maxar (=1): max(arp, parp). 
-	h (=1): number of time steps ahead to forecast
-	nsims (=1000): number of simulations for bootstrapping
-	train (=365): train a model on the first [train] time steps.
